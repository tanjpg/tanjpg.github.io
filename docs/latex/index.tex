Welcome to the Doxygen page for the easy\+\_\+manipulation\+\_\+deployment suite

This package was tested with the \href{https://github.com/ros-industrial/easy_perception_deployment}{\texttt{ easy\+\_\+perception\+\_\+deployment}} R\+O\+S2 package, but any other perception system that provides the same R\+O\+S2 message in the right topic can work with this package as well.

It is recommended to run this package on {\bfseries{R\+O\+S2 Foxy}}.
